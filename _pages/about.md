I am Mahdi Hasan, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Marine, Earth, and Atmospheric Sciences (MEAS) at North Carolina State University. My research broadly focuses on large-scale atmospheric and oceanic circulations, climate variability, and climate change. I earned my Ph.D. in Climate and Atmospheric Science from NC State in 2025, and before that, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Mechanical Engineering with a focus on Computational Fluid Dynamics.
